You would think if it’s the same product it would fit the same size but just a different color. I am so upset because I already took the tag off and I cannot return them, I thought that after a wash it would fit better but no I was wrong. I am so upset with this purchase and will not be buying again. I attached two photos. The gray pants i bought from a verified retailer of champion it was made in Honduras, and the black champion joggers I bought from amazon had tag saying made in Pakistan, also each tag has a different material feel to it. IF IT IS THE SAME JOGGER WHY MADE IN DIFF PLACES? This is why I believe the black joggers I bought from this retailer is not actually champion. I wish I could get my money back.\",\n",
